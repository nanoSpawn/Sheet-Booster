Sheet-Booster
=============

PHP script to generate an XML of numbers ready to ease up digital printing of numbered tickets.

You can find the latest operative version in:

Right now this small script requires PHP 5+, I understand it's a big hassle for such a thing, so it's in the TODO list to convert this to HTML+JS, so it'd be a standalone script.

Also, doesn't work well with huge (10k+ elements) XML, getting stuck a lot. Hopefully the conversion to JS will fix it. Or not.
